      <p><strong>Case - Problem Statement</strong></p>
      <p>Danny loves Japanese food, so he opens up a cute little restaurant serving his three favorite dishes: sushi, curry, and ramen. After a few months of running Danny’s Diner, he collects some basic data but isn’t sure how to use it. He’s looking for help to answer a few simple questions that will allow him to improve the experience for his loyal customers. Due to privacy concerns, he shares only a sample of the data — but hopes it’s enough to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!</p>
