      <p><strong>Case - Problem Statement</strong></p>
      <p>Danny loves Japanese food, so he opens up a cute little restaurant serving his three favorite dishes: sushi, curry, and ramen. After a few months of running Dannyâ€™s Diner, he collects some basic data but isnâ€™t sure how to use it. Heâ€™s looking for help to answer a few simple questions that will allow him to improve the experience for his loyal customers. Due to privacy concerns, he shares only a sample of the data â€” but hopes itâ€™s enough to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!</p>
